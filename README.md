## data

The video I used in this tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YmHTElM6rh5uBpvaoUYpYTHK2odJkoM6/view?usp=drive_link).

## models

A Yolov8 pretrained model was used to detect vehicles.

A licensed plate detector was used to detect license plates. The model was trained with Yolov8 using [this dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4). <br>
The trained model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UtZCClx2A3KK9s4QuC4vQQdWlCSTSHW7/view?usp=sharing).

## dependencies

The sort module needs to be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/abewley/sort) as mentioned in the [video](https://youtu.be/fyJB1t0o0ms?t=1120).
